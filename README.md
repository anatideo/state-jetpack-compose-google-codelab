# state-jetpack-compose-google-codelab

All applications handle state: whether it is your list of bookmarked items or the products in your shopping cart, your application needs to be able to request information, process it, and display the UI according to the current state. It should also handle updates of this state, which can happen from different sources. With Compose, handling state doesn’t have to be difficult! In this workshop you’ll learn hands-on how the unidirectional data flow works, how to manage state and work with APIs like remember, rememberSaveable and mutableStateOf to build rich and interactive Compose applications.
